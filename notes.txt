Cmake: makes makefile(or any other equivalent build files in other environments) which in turn work with compiler to build the code.
This makes cmake useful for building crossplatform stuff

cmakelist in root: basic setup and dependencies management
cmakelist in src folder: list of source files and executables
separate lists lets us make multiple executables and libraries

vcpkg: open source packet manager

raylib: open source games dev library

in root: ./vcpkg/vcpkg install raylib
to install raylib using vcpkg, but required a newer version of cmake
installed new cmake using tar file then,
./configure
make
sudo make install

new cmake requires OpenSSL, sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

run cmake: mkdir build;cd build; cmake ..
then run make
compile: gcc pong/CMakeFiles/pong.dir/src/main.c.o -o main
run: ./main
